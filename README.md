# Visualising Internet users data
# Visualising Internet users data and Comparing it with GDP growth rate

Since I am a Mater’s student, working with data has always been part of my daily tasks and routine. 
Having no background in programming I tried my luck with modern tools like Tableau and Power BI 
along with conventional tools like Excel. 
But Python was something I always wondered about,
So in the last few months I started learning python on my own and after a lot of attempts,
I am publishing my first Visualisation. 
It is not great but I hope it will help someone in attempts to learn python.
For the visualisation, we need to have some data.
There are two datasets I have used:
 1. Internet Users (Per 100 People), from Kaggle.
    The data contains Country-wise number of Internet users per 100 People from 1960 to 2016.
 2. I have scraped a table of GDP data from Wikipedia page with Real GDP growth rate(%) from 2013 to 2018.
 
In the process to visualise data I have cleaned the data
(Cleaning data Jupiter notebook: https://github.com/rakshitratan/Cleaning-and-Tidying-Data) 
as many of the cells as well as rows in the Internet Users dataset are null or empty.
Also, I have tried to Visualise data to showcase the different types of python functions and libraries. 
The analysis in itself is pretty basic but the lessons I acquired in the making of this visualisation are amazing. 
I hope some of you feel the same way.
